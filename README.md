Bubble is a news aggregation community platform designed to combat misinformation and foster a globally connected community. Utilizing AI-powered bias detection and media literacy tools, Bubble empowers users to critically engage with diverse perspectives, promoting informed decision-making and driving actionable change. Bubble approaches these issues with a focus on journalistic bias detection and explainability. 

## Key Features
- **Diverse News Aggregation:** We source content from across the political spectrum, different regions of the world, and multiple perspectives within the same political leaning. In addition, media can also be user-generated in the form of video uploads (minimum of three minute content) and opinion pieces. The content will be organized into localized datasets based on primary and secondary topic categorizations. 




## Bubble Tweet Generator

`bubble_tweets.py` is a lightweight demo script that creates short bubble-style summaries from example news articles. It shows how different viewpoints on a topic can be condensed into tweet-sized snippets.

### Usage

```bash
python bubble_tweets.py
```

The script prints a short summary for each sample article along with its labeled perspective. You can modify `sample_articles` in the script to experiment with your own sources.
