## Key Features
- **Diverse News Aggregation:** We source content from across the political spectrum, different regions of the world, and multiple perspectives within the same political leaning. In addition, media can also be user-generated in the form of video uploads (minimum of three minute content) and opinion pieces. The content will be organized into localized datasets based on primary and secondary topic categorizations.
